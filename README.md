# openwrt x86-64 firmware with luci-app-xray integrated
luci-app-xray integrated in openwrt-x86-64

Integrated luci-app-xray, can be used for xray. If you are using x86-64 router, you can find the firmware in this project.

It's clean, and only integrates these more 6 pakakges: luci, irqbalance, xray-core, geoip, geosite, luci-app-xray.

Already tested on x86-64 router, and works fine.

admin ip: 192.168.1.1 
default lan port: LAN1  
user: root  
password: (none)  

You can adjust the lan port & wan port by youself then when you login into the router.  


Enjoy!
