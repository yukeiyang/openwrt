# openwrt x86-64 firmware with luci-app-xray integrated  

It's clean, integrates 6 packages only, luci, irqbalance, xray-core, v2ray-geosite, v2ray-geoip, luci-app-xray.   

You should adjust & switch lan/wan port after you flash this firmware on your x86 router.  

default admin ip: 192.168.1.1  
default lan port: LAN1  
user: root  
password: (none)  

Enjoy!
