# openwrt x86-64 firmware with luci-app-xray integrated  

This is a firmware based on openwrt x86-64, with luci-app-xray plugin integrated.  
  
It is really fucking clean, containing luci-app-homeproxy and its dependences only. I really hate one firmware installed lots of complicated IPKs. That's why I create this firmware.
  
You can choose `Keep settings and retain the current configuration` during the `Flash Image` when you flash this firmware.  
  
Orï¼Œyou can flash the image as a brand new one.
