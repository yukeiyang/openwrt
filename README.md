# openwrt x86-64 firmware with luci-app-xray integrated
luci-app-xray integrated in openwrt-x86-64  

It's clean, and only integrates these 6 packages: luci, irqbalance, xray-core, geoip, geosite, luci-app-xray.  
Please adjust lan port & wan port by youself when you login into the router.  

default admin ip: 192.168.1.1  
default lan port: LAN1  
user: root  
password: (none)  

Enjoy!
